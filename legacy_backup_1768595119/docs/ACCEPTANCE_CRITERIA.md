## Visual consistency
- Single cyan accent only (no secondary hues)
- Iridescence appears only when allowed
- Gold appears only during Bow closure
- Background stays true black

## Entry sequence
- Canonical order preserved
- Wheel→spring transform reads clearly
- Axis descent reads as flying into center
- Blackout is clean
- Cymatic mandala shifts then snaps

## Floor
- Checkerboard reveal is legible
- LOD: near crisp, far ghosted
- Tile motion reflects computed state (calm/erratic/parked)
- Camera pan/tilt/zoom smooth

## Interaction
- Tap tile → natal wireframe overlay + gift↔shadow cube slider
- Family overlay shows computed members
- Timeline spiral view reachable and readable

## Performance
- 60fps desktop target
- 30–60fps mobile target with adaptive LOD
- No memory leaks
- Reduce Motion respected
