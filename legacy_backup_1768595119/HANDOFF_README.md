# DEFRAG — Antigravity Handoff (Single-Package Build + Spec)

This package is the **single source handoff** for Google Antigravity (AI agent + team) to build a polished DEFRAG product, aligned to the locked plan from the initial thread.

## What’s inside
- `/web/` — runnable Vite + Three.js prototype with the full entry sequence wired (wheel → spiral → axis → blackout → cymatic snap → floor A/B/C).
- `/docs/` — authoritative spec (non‑negotiables), acceptance criteria, and build plan.
- `/agent/` — a single instruction prompt to paste into Antigravity to drive work without drift.

## How to run (Mac)
1. Open terminal in `web/`
2. Install and run:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run dev`
3. Open the local URL shown (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Non-negotiables (summary)
- Void-first (true black), monochrome base
- Single accent hue: electric cyan (intensity/phase only)
- Iridescence only on user input, titles, snap-to-form
- Gold only during "The Bow" (closure)
- No self-report state. No feeds. No gamification.
- Infinite logical floor, finite rendered radius (LOD)
- Others are anonymous but represented as live state via mandala motion
- Family layers are computed (natal) and overlayed as system dynamics

## Where to start
Read `/docs/SPEC_BIBLE.md`, then open `/agent/ANTIGRAVITY_PROMPT.md` and use it as the primary build instruction.
